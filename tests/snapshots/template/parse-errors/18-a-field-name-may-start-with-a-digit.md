# A field name may start with a digit

Nothing stops a template from naming a field that could not exist, so it has
to fail as an unknown field rather than as a lexing accident — the message a
person reading `{{2ndSinger}}` needs is that the field is wrong, not that the
`2` surprised the tokenizer.
