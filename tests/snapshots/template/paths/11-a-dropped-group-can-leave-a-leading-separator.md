# A dropped group can leave a leading separator

The template is not absolute; the leading group vanished and left the
separator behind. `split_path` tests `starts_with('/')` on the rendered
string before it collapses empty segments, so the diagnostic names a cause
that is not the real one. Recorded as it behaves today.
